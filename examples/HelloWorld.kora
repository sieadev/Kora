// 'Entry' class:
// This is the entry point of your Kora programm.
// Because Kora does not have static methods the infamous 
// 'public static void main...' does not work here. Instead
// The compiler makes sure there is at most one entry class
// (and method), which an instance will be created of when
// your programm is first executed. Honestly I would love 
// to hear feedback on this idea.
